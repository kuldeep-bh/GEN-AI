Single & Multi-Agent Chatbot using LangGraph & Groq
1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen rapid growth in recent years, particularly in the field of conversational agents, commonly referred to as chatbots. Chatbots are software programs designed to simulate human conversation using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. They have become essential in customer support, personal assistants, marketing, education, and numerous other domains. The evolution of chatbots has moved from simple rule-based systems to complex, stateful, and multi-agent architectures capable of handling nuanced and context-aware interactions.

This project focuses on building single-agent and multi-agent chatbots using two cutting-edge technologies: LangGraph and Groq. LangGraph is a Python library for creating graph-based, stateful AI workflows, while Groq provides ultra-fast AI hardware and APIs capable of running large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Together, these technologies enable the creation of chatbots that are not only intelligent but also scalable, modular, and capable of managing complex conversational flows.

2. Technologies Overview
2.1 LangGraph

LangGraph is built on top of LangChain and allows developers to construct stateful AI workflows using a graph-based approach. In LangGraph:

Nodes represent specific tasks such as API calls, function executions, or LLM interactions.

Edges define the flow of information between nodes, enabling branching logic and sequential or parallel task execution.

This modular design allows developers to visualize, debug, and extend chatbots with ease. It also supports multi-agent setups where multiple chatbot agents can collaborate or operate independently within the same conversation framework.

2.2 Groq

Groq is an AI hardware company providing high-performance computing solutions optimized for machine learning. Its Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) enables running LLMs with minimal latency and high throughput, often outperforming traditional GPUs. Through the ChatGroq API, developers can connect their applications to LLM models hosted on Groq hardware, allowing rapid and efficient AI response generation.

2.3 API and API Keys

An API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a bridge between different software systems, allowing one program to request services or data from another. API keys are unique authentication codes used to control access, track usage, and ensure secure communication between applications. In this project, API keys are required to access the Groq services.

3. Chatbot Architecture

The architecture of both single-agent and multi-agent chatbots revolves around three main elements: state, workflow nodes, and StateGraph construction. These components work together to manage conversation context, process user input, and generate AI responses.

3.1 State Definition

The state is the memory of the chatbot. It stores:

Previous messages

User information and preferences

Session variables

Temporary flags

State is crucial for maintaining multi-turn conversations, allowing the chatbot to respond intelligently without forgetting the context of the dialogue. In multi-agent setups, the state can be local to an agent or shared globally among agents for coordinated interactions.

3.2 Workflow Nodes

Workflow nodes are individual steps in the chatbot’s graph. Each node performs a specific task such as:

Input processing

Decision-making

LLM/API calls

Output generation

Nodes are modular, enabling developers to add, remove, or reuse them without affecting the entire system. Common nodes include:

Input Node: Captures user messages

Decision Node: Applies logic to determine flow

LLM Node: Invokes AI model for response generation

API Node: Calls external services

Output Node: Delivers the response to the user

3.3 StateGraph Construction

The StateGraph is the backbone of the chatbot workflow. It connects nodes using edges to define the conversation flow. Conditional branching allows the chatbot to handle different user inputs intelligently. StateGraph supports:

Single-agent linear flows: Simple step-by-step conversation

Multi-agent workflows: Parallel or coordinated execution among multiple agents

Visualization tools allow developers to graphically inspect the workflow, making debugging and optimization straightforward.

4. Single-Agent Chatbot Implementation

The single-agent chatbot is the simplest form of the system. It consists of:

State definition: Stores messages

Chatbot node: Sends messages to the LLM via ChatGroq

Flow edges: Defines the sequence of execution (START → Chatbot → END)

The Python implementation initializes the LLM model with a Groq API key, constructs a workflow graph, and streams user input through the chatbot node. The chatbot maintains context and provides coherent multi-turn responses.

Key Advantages:

Easy to implement and extend

Maintains conversation history

Generates responses quickly with Groq LLM

5. Multi-Agent Chatbot Implementation

The multi-agent chatbot adds complexity and intelligence by incorporating multiple workflow nodes, each responsible for a distinct function. Typical nodes include:

Preprocessing Node: Cleans the user input

Sentiment Analysis Node: Detects positive, neutral, or negative sentiment

Chatbot Node: Sends processed messages to LLM for response

Logging Node: Records messages and sentiment for monitoring

The workflow flow is defined as:

START → Preprocess → Sentiment Analysis → Chatbot → Logger → END


This setup allows:

Parallel or sequential processing of tasks

Modular addition of new nodes (e.g., translation, summarization)

Context-aware responses that consider user sentiment

The Python implementation uses LangGraph’s StateGraph to manage state, connect nodes, and maintain multi-turn conversation history. Streaming allows real-time interaction with the chatbot while logging provides visibility into the system’s operation.

6. Message Processing & Output

Message processing in both single and multi-agent setups involves:

Routing input: Directs the message to the appropriate node

Preprocessing: Cleans text, detects intent, or applies filters

LLM invocation: Generates the AI response

State update: Appends new messages to the conversation history

Outputs can be:

Text messages

Structured data (e.g., JSON responses)

Aggregated multi-agent responses

Example of a multi-agent response:

LOG: Hello Kuldeep!  It’s nice to meet you. Sentiment: neutral
Chatbot: Hello Kuldeep!  How can I assist you today? 

7. Advantages of Graph-Based Chatbots

Stateful memory → enables coherent multi-turn conversations

Modular design → easy addition/removal of nodes

Multi-agent support → coordination and parallel processing

High-speed LLM inference → using Groq hardware

These advantages make the chatbot highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for complex applications like customer service, educational tools, or interactive personal assistants.

8. Technologies Used

LangGraph: Workflow and state management

ChatGroq / Groq LLMs: Fast AI response generation

Python: Implementation language

Optional: APIs, databases, visualization libraries

Dependencies can be installed via:

pip install langgraph langsmith
pip install langchain langchain_groq langchain_community

9. Practical Example
input_message = "hello kuldeep here."
final_state = graph.invoke({"messages": ("user", input_message)})

print("Chatbot's response:", final_state['messages'][-1].content)
print("Detected Sentiment:", final_state['sentiment'])


Output:

LOG: Hello Kuldeep!  It's nice to meet you. Sentiment: neutral
Chatbot's response: Hello Kuldeep!  It's nice to meet you. What can I do for you today? 
Detected Sentiment: neutral


This demonstrates stateful, context-aware conversation where the chatbot remembers and responds intelligently.

10. Conclusion

The combination of LangGraph and Groq enables the creation of stateful, efficient, and modular chatbots. Single-agent systems are suitable for simpler tasks, while multi-agent architectures allow preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and logging in addition to AI responses. The graph-based approach ensures maintainability, scalability, and real-time interaction capabilities.

By leveraging state tracking, modular workflow nodes, and high-speed LLM inference, these chatbots are well-suited for real-world applications across industries such as customer service, education, healthcare, and entertainment.
